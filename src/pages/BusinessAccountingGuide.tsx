              In order to maintain consistency and accuracy in financial reporting, every business transaction must be meticulously documented and reported. But the accounting method in which this needs to be done and would best fit your company's needs requires an understanding of the various approaches.

                  Transactions are only recorded in cash basis accounting when actual cash is exchanged. Expenses are recorded when they are paid, and revenues are recognised when they are received. This approach is easy to use and appropriate for small companies that deal with simple financial transactions.

                    As your business expands, you should think about adopting accrual basis accounting which matches revenues with expenses closer in time, thereby giving a more accurate indication of profitability. Especially, if you frequently make credit sales or allow customers longer periods within which they must settle their accounts payable, then the accrual system will be better.
